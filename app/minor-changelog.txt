- Move .bashrc's and .zshrc's backups and calculation history from /home/<username> folder to /home/<username>/.local/share/grelintb folder. This keeps the user's home folder cleaner.
- Switch to DNF5. This allows GrelinTB to prepare for Fedora Linux 41 and experience the benefits of DNF5.
- Add Hyprland for Fedora Linux and Arch Linux baseds.
- Add "Listing Installed Leaves" for Fedora Linux baseds. According to DNF5's wiki, it's is useful because: The list gives you a nice overview of what is installed on your system without flooding you with anything required by the packages already shown.
- Change "Traditional" texts in Store to more meaningful expressions.
- Fix text of distribution synchronizing button.
- Remove group reinstalling for Fedora Linux baseds. Because DNF (both of DNF4 and DNF5) doesn't support it.
- Remove fixing broken dependencies for Fedora Linux baseds.
- Remove distribution synchronizing for Arch Linux baseds.
- Fix that things that some distributions do not support in the traditional scripts section are enabled after any operation.
