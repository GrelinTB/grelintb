- Added package name, search, update to "General Applications" section.
- Removed "Other Apps" section due to the change above.
- Added "Flatpak Applications" section for Flatpak.
- Overhauled installation methods for Fedora Linux based distributions in the "Desktop Environment/Window Manager" section.
- Added progress bar and status text to "Desktop Environment/Window Manager", "General Applications" and "Other Applications" sections.
- The general status text can now take 2 forms. The reason is that it will be wrong when multiple processes are started at the same time. That's why we switched to independent status texts.
- Updated some variable names.
