--- General
- The language system has completely changed: Now the language texts are pulled from a json file. This made the code cleaner.
- Optimization has been done: All features now run as a separate thread. Also, the number of lines of code has been reduced from 2595 to 1970, although the interface has been greatly refreshed and beautified thanks to the use of dynamic variables and loops.
- Unnecessary message boxes etc. have been removed.
--- Sidebar
- The change logs windows have been overhauled.
- Changed “Ready” to “Idle” in the status text.
- Changed “List of All Operations” to “Running Processes” and changed the text style about the running process.
--- Startup
- Added number of packs.
- Minor improvements to the text.
--- Notes and Documents
- Remaded.
- Now 8 notes or documents can be opened and edited at the same time. The reason for not 8 is that if there are no other files with that name, the first 4 letters are the name of that tab. More than 8 creates a bad image when all slots are used.
