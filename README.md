# GrelinTB (in alpha stage)
- UI completed except DE/WM store.
- Process completed except those requiring root rights.
## To do:
- Make DE/WM store's UI: Most probably last version under v0.2
- Add processes that require root rights and removing pass sections (I'm thinking of using new Python file and pkexec): Most probably under v0.3
- Make icon.
- Make wiki (most probably) or website.
- Release: Of course v1.0.0.0!
